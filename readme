random_walker.c
Random walk across a n x n array, where n is defined by #define.
Assume the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, randomly generated corresponds to the direction up, right, down, and left, respectively.
When the cell x is selected by the new direction and it is already occupied, 
it first tries to jump over cell x to find if the neighboring cell (say cell y ) of x along the selected direction is not occupied, 
the next letter should be placed in cell y.

fibonocci.c
Write a recursive function int Fibonocci(void) that does not have any parameter but use a global variable n to compute.
